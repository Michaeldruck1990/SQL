--For this project, I downloaded a databse containing information on a digital media store.
--I then created a table to insert the digital media store data into. 
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--First I showed data for customers who are not residents of the United States.
SELECT Firstname, Lastname, Customerid, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

--I then narrowed my search to show information for customers who only live in Brazil.
SELECT * FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Brazil" ;

--Next, I found the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
on inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

--Then, I explored the data to find all employees who are Sales Agents. 
SELECT * FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent" ;

-- Then, I found a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table to see all of the countries orders were placed.
SELECT DISTINCT(Billingcountry) 
FROM chinook.invoices;

--Next, I provided a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.
SELECT Employees.Firstname, Employees.Lastname, Invoices.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees
JOIN chinook.Customers ON customers.SupportRepId = Employees.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices ON Invoices.CustomerId = Customers.CustomerId;

--My next SQL was to show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT invoices.Total, Customers.FirstName, Customers.LastName, Customers.Country, Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName
FROM chinook.employees
JOIN chinook.customers ON customers.SupportRepId = Employees.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices ON Invoices.CustomerId = Customers.CustomerId;

--I then investigated the data to find out how many Invoices there were in 2009.
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--Continuing on that data path led me to find what were the total sales for 2009.
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--I then wrote a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT Tracks.Name, Invoice_Items.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks
JOIN chinook.invoice_items ON Tracks.TrackId = Invoice_Items.TrackId;

--My next goal was to write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT artists.Name AS Artist, tracks.Name AS Track, invoice_items.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.artists
JOIN chinook.albums ON artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId
JOIN chinook.tracks ON albums.AlbumId = tracks.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.invoice_items ON tracks.TrackId = invoice_items.TrackId;

--Next I provided a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT albums.Title AS Album, tracks.Name AS Track, genres.Name AS Genre, media_types.Name AS Media
FROM chinook.tracks
JOIN chinook.albums ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.genres ON tracks.GenreId = genres.GenreId
JOIN chinook.media_types ON tracks.MediaTypeId = media_types.MediaTypeId;

--Then I showed the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, ROUND(SUM(Invoices.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees
JOIN chinook.customers ON employees.EmployeeId = customers.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.InvoiceId
WHERE employees.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY employees.FirstName;

--Using that data, I discovered which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009.
SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, ROUND(SUM(Invoices.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees
JOIN chinook.customers ON employees.EmployeeId = customers.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.InvoiceId
WHERE employees.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND invoices.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY employees.FirstName
ORDER BY (ROUND(SUM(invoices.Total), 2)) DESC
LIMIT 1; 

--Finally I wanted to create a list of which playlists containted which tracks, plus the artists and albums asscoiated with each. 
SELECT playlists.Name AS Playlist, tracks.Name AS Track, artists.Name AS Artist, albums.Title AS Album
FROM chinook.tracks
JOIN chinook.playlist_track ON tracks.TrackId = playlist_track.TrackId
JOIN chinook.playlists ON playlist_track.PlaylistId = playlists.PlaylistId
JOIN chinook.albums ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.artists ON albums.ArtistId = artists.ArtistId;
